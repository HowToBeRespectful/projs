<ul>
<li>The purpose of our lives is to be happy. </li>
<li>Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. </li>
<li>Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.. </li>
<li>Your wounds hold your gifts. </li>
<li>If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor. </li>
<li>Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced. </li>
<li>Donâ€™t settle for what life gives you; make life better and build something. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>life can be scary</strong></p>
